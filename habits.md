# Polymath Habit List (INTP 5w4 Edition)

## Philosophy: The Slight Edge
As an INTP 5w4, you likely struggle with "Analysis Paralysis" or getting lost in theory. The goal here is **Action over Abstraction**. Each habit is small enough that skipping it feels harder than doing it.

## 1. Machine Learning (The Logician's Core)
*Goal: Deep understanding combined with practical application.*
- **[ ] Read 1 Abstract (5 mins):** Read the abstract and conclusion of one ML paper per day. Don't force the whole paper unless hooked.
- **[ ] The "One Function" Rule (15 mins):** Write or refactor just *one* Python function or experiment with *one* small concept (e.g., a specific loss function) in a Jupyter notebook.
- **[ ] Math Micro-Dose (10 mins):** Solve one Linear Algebra or Calculus problem, or review one probability concept.

## 2. Piano (The System)
*Goal: Technical proficiency and expression.*
- **[ ] Scales & Arpeggios (5 mins):** rigorous, mechanical warm-up. INTPs find comfort in the logic of music theory.
- **[ ] Sight Read 4 Bars (5 mins):** Only 4 bars of a new piece. Focus on pattern recognition.
- **[ ] Improvise (5 mins):** Play freely using a specific constraint (e.g., "Only use black keys" or "Only Dorian mode").

## 3. Singing (The Instrument)
*Goal: Vocal control and ear training.*
- **[ ] Pitch Matching (5 mins):** Use a tuner app. Hum a note, check the app, adjust.
- **[ ] Sirens & Lip Trills (2 mins):** Do this while making coffee or booting up your computer.
- **[ ] One Verse (5 mins):** Sing one verse of a song you are learning, recording it to listen back for objective analysis.

## 4. Dancing (The Embodiment)
*Goal: Body awareness (getting out of your head).*
- **[ ] Isolation Drills (5 mins):** Focus on moving *only* your chest, hips, or shoulders while standing still.
- **[ ] The "One Song" Groove (3 mins):** Put on a track and just move. No choreography, just rhythm.

## 5. Calisthenics (The Foundation)
*Goal: Strength and discipline.*
- **[ ] Grease the Groove (Throughout day):** Do 5 pushups or 2 pullups every time you enter a specific room or take a break.
- **[ ] 5-Minute Compression (Morning):** 1 min Plank, 1 min Hollow Body hold, 1 min Squat hold.
- **[ ] Joint Mobility (5 mins):** Wrists and shoulders (crucial for Piano and Calisthenics).

## 6. Anti-Procrastination (For the INTP Mind)
- **[ ] The 2-Minute Entry:** If you don't feel like doing a task, agree to do it for only 2 minutes. Usually, you'll keep going.
- **[ ] Brain Dump Journaling (Evening):** Write down the "noise" in your head so you can sleep or focus.

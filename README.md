## The System (INTP 5w4 Edition)

This system is built on the philosophy of **"The Slight Edge"**—small, non-negotiable daily actions that compound over time.

### Tracks
*   **Machine Learning (The Logician's Core):** Focus on understanding papers and writing code daily.
*   **Music (Piano & Vocal):** Technical precision (scales) and creative freedom (improv).
*   **Body (Dance & Calisthenics):** Connection to the physical self, greasing the groove.
*   **Mind (Systems):** Overcoming analysis paralysis with 2-minute starts.
